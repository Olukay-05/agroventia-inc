# AgroVentia Inc. Homepage SPA Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
- Establish professional digital presence for AgroVentia Inc. startup launch
- Create engaging, modern homepage experience with parallax effects and animations
- Implement multi-language support for Canadian and international markets
- Build scalable technical foundation for future full website and e-commerce expansion
- Enable contact pathways for B2B and B2C customer inquiries
- Deliver production-ready SPA within 2-week development timeline

### Background Context

AgroVentia Inc. is an agricultural import startup launching operations in Canada with plans for international expansion. As a new company in the competitive agricultural import market, they need to establish immediate credibility and professional presence to attract B2B partners and consumers. The current lack of digital presence creates barriers to business development and market entry.

This homepage SPA serves as the critical first touchpoint for the company's digital strategy, requiring modern design aesthetics with smooth animations and parallax effects to create memorable first impressions. The solution must support multiple languages to serve both Canadian (English/French) and international markets while providing a scalable foundation for future e-commerce development.
