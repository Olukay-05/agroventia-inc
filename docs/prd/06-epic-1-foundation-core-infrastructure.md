## Epic 1: Foundation & Core Infrastructure

Establish the technical foundation for the AgroVentia homepage SPA including project setup, Wix Studio Headless integration, and basic homepage structure. This epic delivers a deployable application with core infrastructure and initial content display, providing the foundation for all subsequent development while ensuring proper CI/CD pipeline configuration.

### Story 1.1: Project Setup and Initial Configuration

As a developer,
I want to set up the Next.js project with required dependencies and configuration,
so that I have a solid foundation for building the AgroVentia homepage SPA with GSAP animations and native i18n support.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. Next.js 14+ project is initialized with TypeScript configuration and native i18n setup
2. Required dependencies are installed: React Query, shadcn/ui, GSAP, and Wix Studio SDK (basic CMS only)
3. ESLint and Prettier are configured with appropriate rules for code quality
4. Basic folder structure is created following Next.js best practices including i18n structure
5. Environment variables are properly configured for development and production
6. Git repository is initialized with appropriate .gitignore and README
7. Package.json scripts are configured for development, build, and deployment

### Story 1.2: Wix Studio Headless CMS Integration

As a developer,
I want to establish connection with Wix Studio Headless CMS for basic content management,
so that content can be managed dynamically without requiring premium subscription features.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. Wix Studio SDK is properly configured and connected for basic CMS functionality only
2. API endpoints are established for basic content retrieval (no premium features)
3. Content models are defined for homepage sections (hero, about, services, contact) using free tier capabilities
4. React Query is configured for API calls with proper error handling
5. API responses are properly typed with TypeScript interfaces
6. Basic content fetching functionality is tested and working with free tier limitations
7. Content structure supports future multi-language expansion through Next.js i18n

### Story 1.3: Basic Homepage Structure and Layout

As a user,
I want to see a basic homepage structure with navigation and content sections,

2. Header section includes logo placeholder and navigation elements
3. Main content area is structured for hero, about, services, and contact sections
4. Footer section includes basic company information and links
5. CSS Grid/Flexbox layout system is implemented for responsive design
6. Basic styling is applied using Tailwind CSS through shadcn/ui
7. Page is accessible via keyboard navigation and screen readers

### Story 1.4: Deployment Pipeline and CI/CD Setup

As a developer,
I want automated deployment to Vercel with proper CI/CD pipeline,
so that code changes can be deployed efficiently and reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. Vercel deployment is configured and connected to Git repository
2. Automated builds are triggered on code commits
3. Environment variables are properly configured in Vercel
4. Preview deployments are generated for pull requests
5. Production deployment is configured for main branch
6. Build optimization is configured for best performance
7. Deployment status and logs are accessible and monitored
