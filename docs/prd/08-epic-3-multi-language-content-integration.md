## Epic 3: Multi-language Implementation & Content Integration

Build Next.js native multi-language functionality and integrate content management through Wix Studio CMS as separate systems. This epic enables AgroVentia to serve Canadian bilingual requirements and international markets through Next.js i18n while providing dynamic content management capabilities through Wix Studio basic CMS for future updates and expansion.

**Architecture Clarification:**
- **Next.js Native i18n:** Handles all multi-language functionality including URL routing (/en, /fr, /esp) and language switching
- **Wix Studio Headless CMS:** Provides content management for homepage sections (basic/free tier only)
- **Separation of Concerns:** Language switching and content management operate independently
