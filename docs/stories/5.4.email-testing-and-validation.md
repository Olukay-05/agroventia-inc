# Story 5.4: Email Testing and Validation

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** quality assurance specialist,
**I want** to thoroughly test the email service integration,
**so that** contact form submissions work reliably in production with professional deliverability.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Email delivery is tested with various form submission scenarios and data inputs
2. Email formatting and content are validated for professional appearance and readability
3. Delivery time is measured and optimized for sub-5-second delivery
4. Error handling is tested with various failure scenarios (network issues, service outages)
5. Email deliverability is tested to ensure messages reach inbox rather than spam
6. Cross-browser and cross-device testing confirms consistent email functionality
7. Security testing validates that email service credentials are properly protected
8. Performance testing confirms email service integration doesn't impact form submission speed
