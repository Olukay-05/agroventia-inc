# Story 3.4: Integration Testing and System Coordination

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** smooth coordination between Next.js i18n language switching and Wix CMS content loading,
**so that** the homepage provides a seamless experience regardless of language selection or content updates.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Language switching works seamlessly with CMS content loading without conflicts
2. Shimmer loading states appear consistently across all language versions
3. Error handling works properly for both language switching and content fetching failures
4. CMS content displays correctly regardless of active language setting
5. Performance remains optimal when combining Next.js i18n with Wix CMS integration
6. Fallback content ensures homepage functionality if either system experiences issues
7. User experience remains consistent across all supported languages (/en, /fr, /esp)

## Dev Notes
Based on the architecture document, the integration testing should focus on:
- Ensuring seamless coordination between Next.js i18n and Wix Studio CMS
- Maintaining consistent shimmer loading states across all language versions
- Implementing robust error handling for both systems
- Ensuring CMS content displays correctly in all supported languages
- Optimizing performance when both systems are active
- Providing fallback content for system failures
- Maintaining consistent user experience across all supported languages

### Testing
- Test language switching with CMS content loading
- Validate shimmer loading state consistency
- Test error handling scenarios for both systems
- Verify CMS content display accuracy across languages
- Measure and optimize combined system performance
- Test fallback mechanisms for both systems
- Validate user experience consistency across languages
