# Story 4.2: Performance Optimization and Core Web Vitals

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** the homepage to load quickly and respond smoothly to interactions,
**so that** I have a positive experience that reflects AgroVentia's professionalism.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) occurs within 2.5 seconds
2. First Input Delay (FID) is less than 100 milliseconds
3. Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) is less than 0.1
4. Images are optimized with proper formats (WebP, AVIF) and lazy loading
5. JavaScript bundles are optimized with code splitting and tree shaking
6. Critical CSS is inlined with non-critical styles loaded asynchronously
7. Performance monitoring is configured to track real user metrics

## Tasks / Subtasks

  - [ ] Test monitoring configuration (AC: 7)

## Dev Notes
Based on the architecture document, the performance optimization should follow these patterns:
- Optimize for Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS)
- Use WebP and AVIF image formats for better compression
- Implement lazy loading for images to improve initial load time
- Apply code splitting and tree shaking to optimize JavaScript bundles
- Inline critical CSS and load non-critical CSS asynchronously
- Configure performance monitoring to track real user metrics
- Follow Next.js optimization best practices

### Testing
- Test LCP performance and optimization
- Validate FID performance improvements
- Check CLS optimization results
- Verify image optimization and lazy loading
- Test JavaScript bundle optimization
- Validate CSS loading optimization
- Confirm performance monitoring is working
