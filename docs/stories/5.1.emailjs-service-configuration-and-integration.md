# Story 5.1: EmailJS Service Configuration and Integration

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to configure and integrate EmailJS service with the contact form,

## Acceptance Criteria
1. EmailJS account is created and configured with appropriate service and template IDs
2. EmailJS public key is properly configured in environment variables
3. Contact form submissions trigger EmailJS service calls with all form data
4. EmailJS service is configured to send emails to contact@agroventia.ca
5. Email template includes all form fields with appropriate formatting and structure
6. Error handling is implemented for EmailJS service failures
7. EmailJS integration is tested with various form submission scenarios
8. Security best practices are followed for handling EmailJS credentials
