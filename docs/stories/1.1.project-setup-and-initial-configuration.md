# Story 1.1: Project Setup and Initial Configuration

## Status

Ready for Done

## Story

**As a** developer,
**I want** to set up the Next.js project with required dependencies and configuration,
**so that** I have a solid foundation for building the AgroVentia homepage SPA with GSAP animations and native i18n support.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Next.js 14+ project is initialized with TypeScript configuration and native i18n setup
2. Required dependencies are installed: React Query, shadcn/ui, GSAP, and Wix Studio SDK (basic CMS only)
3. ESLint and Prettier are configured with appropriate rules for code quality
4. Basic folder structure is created following Next.js best practices including i18n structure
5. Environment variables are properly configured for development and production
6. Git repository is initialized with appropriate .gitignore and README
7. Package.json scripts are configured for development, build, and deployment

## Dev Notes

Based on the architecture document, the project setup should follow these patterns:

- Use Next.js 14+ with App Router as the foundation
- Implement TypeScript configuration following project standards
- Set up ESLint and Prettier with consistent rules
- Follow the project structure defined in the architecture documentation
- Use environment variables for configuration management

### Testing

- Verify Next.js project initializes correctly with TypeScript
- Test that all dependencies install without conflicts
- Validate ESLint and Prettier configurations work properly
- Confirm Git repository initializes with proper .gitignore
- Test that package.json scripts execute correctly

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-19

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

The implementation follows good practices with a clear project structure aligned with the architecture document. The setup properly separates concerns with components, hooks, and utilities, uses consistent naming conventions, and appropriately uses TypeScript for type safety.

### Refactoring Performed

No refactoring was necessary as this story involved creating new files rather than modifying existing code.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ Follows established patterns for Next.js, TypeScript, and shadcn/ui
- Project Structure: ✓ Aligns with the defined architecture document
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Prepared for implementation of the defined testing approach
- All ACs Met: ✓ All acceptance criteria have been fully implemented and verified

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] Verified Next.js project initialization with TypeScript and i18n support
- [x] Verified installation and configuration of all required dependencies
- [x] Verified ESLint and Prettier configuration
- [x] Verified basic folder structure creation
- [x] Verified environment variables configuration
- [x] Verified Git repository initialization
- [x] Verified package.json scripts configuration

### Security Review

No security vulnerabilities identified in this setup story. The configuration follows standard secure practices for a Next.js application.

### Performance Considerations

The setup is optimized for performance with Next.js automatic code splitting, properly configured TypeScript for compile-time optimizations, and GSAP installed for high-performance animations.

### Files Modified During Review
