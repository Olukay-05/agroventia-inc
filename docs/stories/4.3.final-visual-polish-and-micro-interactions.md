# Story 4.3: Final Visual Polish and Micro-interactions

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** visitor,
**I want** delightful GSAP-powered micro-interactions and polished visual details throughout the homepage,
**so that** AgroVentia appears innovative and attention-to-detail focused.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Button hover states and click animations provide satisfying feedback using GSAP
2. Form interactions include smooth focus transitions and validation animations powered by GSAP
3. Scroll progress indicator shows user position with smooth GSAP animations
4. Shimmer loading animations are branded and consistent with overall design aesthetic
5. GSAP transition effects between content sections feel natural and purposeful
6. Animation preferences are respected for users with reduced motion settings
7. All interactive elements have appropriate touch targets for mobile users

## Dev Notes
Based on the architecture document, the visual polish should follow these patterns:
- Use GSAP for smooth micro-interactions and animations
- Implement satisfying feedback for button interactions
- Add smooth transitions for form interactions and validation
- Create a branded scroll progress indicator with GSAP animations
- Ensure shimmer loading animations match the design aesthetic
- Implement natural section transition effects with GSAP
- Respect user preferences for reduced motion
- Optimize interactive elements for mobile touch targets

### Testing
- Test button hover and click animations
- Validate form interaction animations
- Check scroll progress indicator functionality
- Verify loading animation branding and consistency
- Test section transition effects
- Confirm reduced motion preference handling
- Validate mobile touch targets and interactions
