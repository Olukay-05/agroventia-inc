# Story 2.2: Hero Section with Parallax Effects

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** visitor,
**I want** to see an impressive hero section with smooth GSAP-powered parallax animations,
**so that** I immediately understand AgroVentia's value proposition and feel engaged by the modern presentation.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Hero section displays compelling headline and subheading about AgroVentia
2. Background includes subtle GSAP-powered parallax scrolling effect with agricultural imagery
3. Call-to-action buttons are prominently displayed with smooth GSAP hover animations
4. Scroll indicator encourages users to explore more content below with animated effects
5. Hero content is fully responsive across all device sizes
6. GSAP animation performance maintains 60fps on modern devices
7. Hero section loads quickly with proper image optimization and shimmer loading states

  - [ ] Optimize background images (AC: 7)
  - [ ] Implement shimmer loading states (AC: 7)
  - [ ] Test performance on various devices (AC: 6)

## Dev Notes
Based on the architecture document, the hero section should follow these patterns:
- Use GSAP for smooth parallax animations and scroll effects
- Implement responsive design following mobile-first principles
- Use optimized images with proper alt text for accessibility
- Follow the color palette and typography defined in the design system
- Implement shimmer loading states for better perceived performance
- Ensure animations maintain 60fps performance on modern devices

### Testing
- Test hero section layout and content on different screen sizes
- Validate parallax scrolling effects and performance
- Test CTA button animations and interactions
- Verify scroll indicator functionality and animations
- Check image optimization and loading performance
- Validate accessibility with screen readers
- Test performance on various devices to ensure 60fps
