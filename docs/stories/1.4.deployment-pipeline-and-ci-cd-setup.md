# Story 1.4: Deployment Pipeline and CI/CD Setup

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** automated deployment to Vercel with proper CI/CD pipeline,
**so that** code changes can be deployed efficiently and reliably.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Vercel deployment is configured and connected to Git repository
2. Automated builds are triggered on code commits
3. Environment variables are properly configured in Vercel
4. Preview deployments are generated for pull requests
5. Production deployment is configured for main branch
6. Build optimization is configured for best performance
7. Deployment status and logs are accessible and monitored

## Dev Notes
Based on the architecture document, the deployment setup should follow these patterns:
- Use Vercel as the deployment platform for Next.js optimization
- Implement CI/CD pipeline with automated builds and deployments
- Configure environment variables securely in Vercel
- Set up both preview and production deployment workflows
- Optimize builds for performance following Next.js best practices

### Testing
- Test Vercel deployment configuration and connectivity
- Validate automated builds trigger correctly on code commits
- Verify environment variables are properly configured and accessible
- Test preview deployments for pull requests
- Confirm production deployment works for main branch
- Validate build optimization settings improve performance
- Check that deployment status and logs are accessible
