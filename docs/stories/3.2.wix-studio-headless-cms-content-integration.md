# Story 3.2: Wix Studio Headless CMS Content Integration

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** content manager,
**I want** all homepage content to be manageable through Wix Studio Headless CMS basic functionality,
**so that** content updates can be made without code changes while operating independently from the multi-language system.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Hero section content is dynamically loaded from Wix Studio basic CMS with proper fallbacks
2. About section story and mission content is CMS-managed with basic rich text support (free tier)
3. Services information is dynamically loaded within free tier constraints for adding/removing categories
4. Contact information and business details are manageable through basic CMS functionality
5. CMS content structure is language-agnostic, allowing Next.js i18n to handle language switching independently
6. Content updates reflect immediately on the live site through proper cache management
7. CMS integration includes proper error handling and shimmer loading states

## Dev Notes
Based on the architecture document, the Wix Studio CMS integration should follow these patterns:
- Use the Wix Studio Headless SDK for basic CMS functionality only
- Implement proper fallbacks for all CMS content
- Design CMS content structure to be language-agnostic
- Use React Query for efficient API state management and caching
- Implement shimmer loading states for better user experience
- Follow error handling patterns from the architecture documentation

### Testing
- Test dynamic loading of hero section content
- Validate about section content with rich text formatting
- Test services section with dynamic categories
- Verify contact information management
- Check language independence of CMS content
- Test cache management and immediate updates
- Validate error handling and loading states
