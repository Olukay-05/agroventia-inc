# Story 5.3: Email Notification System and Error Handling

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** business stakeholder,
**I want** to ensure contact form submissions are reliably delivered and errors are properly handled,
**so that** no potential customer inquiries are lost and issues can be quickly resolved.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Email notifications are sent immediately upon form submission with all relevant information
2. Confirmation message is displayed to users upon successful email delivery
3. Error messages are displayed to users if email delivery fails with clear next steps
4. Email delivery failures are logged for monitoring and troubleshooting
5. Retry mechanism is implemented for temporary delivery failures
6. Fallback notification method is available if primary email service is unavailable
7. Email delivery success rate is monitored and reported
8. Alerting system is configured for critical email delivery failures

## Dev Notes
Based on the architecture document, the email notification system should:
- Use the existing EmailJS integration
- Follow the error handling patterns shown in the architecture
- Implement proper logging as demonstrated in the code examples
- Provide user feedback that matches the design system

### Testing
- Test successful email delivery flow
- Test error handling scenarios
- Validate retry mechanism with simulated failures
- Test fallback notification system
- Verify logging and monitoring are working correctly
