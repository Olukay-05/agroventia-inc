# Story 3.1: Next.js Native Multi-language Infrastructure

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As an** international visitor,
**I want** to view the homepage content in my preferred language using Next.js native i18n system,
**so that** I can understand AgroVentia's offerings and communicate effectively with the company.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Next.js i18n configuration is set up with support for English, French, and Spanish (/en, /fr, /esp routing)
2. Language selector is prominently displayed in the header with clear visual indicators
3. Language switching occurs instantly using Next.js i18n without page reload or content flash
4. All static text content supports multiple languages through Next.js i18n localization files
5. Language preference is stored and managed through Next.js i18n routing and cookies
6. URL structure accommodates language routing with proper fallbacks and redirects
7. Right-to-left language support is prepared for future expansion within Next.js i18n framework

## Dev Notes
Based on the architecture document, the multi-language implementation should follow these patterns:
- Use Next.js native i18n for all multi-language functionality
- Implement URL routing with /en, /fr, /esp structure
- Ensure language switching is instant without page reload
- Store language preferences using Next.js i18n routing and cookies
- Prepare the framework for future RTL language support
- Follow accessibility guidelines for the language selector

### Testing
- Test Next.js i18n configuration and URL routing
- Validate language selector placement and functionality
- Test instant language switching without page reload
- Verify all static text content is properly localized
- Check language preference storage and persistence
- Test URL fallbacks and redirects
- Validate preparation for RTL language support
