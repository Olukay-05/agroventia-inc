# Story 2.1: Design System and Component Library Setup

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to establish a consistent design system with reusable components,
**so that** the homepage maintains visual consistency and professional appearance.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Color palette is defined with CSS custom properties for brand consistency
2. Typography scale is implemented with appropriate font families and weights
3. Spacing and sizing system is configured using consistent design tokens
4. Button components are created with multiple variants (primary, secondary, outline)
5. Card components are designed for content sections with proper shadows and borders
6. Form components are styled for contact sections with validation states
7. All components follow accessibility guidelines with proper focus states

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Define design system tokens
  - [ ] Create color palette with CSS custom properties (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Implement typography scale with font families and weights (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Configure spacing and sizing system with design tokens (AC: 3)
- [ ] Create button components
  - [ ] Design primary button variant (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Design secondary button variant (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Design outline button variant (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Ensure all button variants follow accessibility guidelines (AC: 7)
- [ ] Create card components
  - [ ] Design card component with shadows and borders (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Implement card variants for different content types (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Ensure card components are accessible (AC: 7)
- [ ] Create form components
  - [ ] Design form input components with validation states (AC: 6)
  - [ ] Create form labels and helper text components (AC: 6)
  - [ ] Implement form error and success states (AC: 6)
- [ ] Implement accessibility features
  - [ ] Add proper ARIA attributes to all components (AC: 7)
  - [ ] Ensure proper focus states for interactive elements (AC: 7)
  - [ ] Test components with screen readers (AC: 7)

## Dev Notes
Based on the architecture document, the design system should follow these patterns:
- Use CSS custom properties for consistent color palette implementation
- Follow the typography guidelines specified in the architecture documentation
- Implement spacing using the design token system defined in the project
- Use shadcn/ui as the component library foundation
- Ensure all components are responsive and accessible

### Testing
- Test color palette implementation across different components
- Validate typography scale implementation and readability
- Verify spacing and sizing consistency across components
- Test button variants for visual consistency and accessibility
- Test card components for proper styling and accessibility
- Test form components with validation states
- Validate accessibility with screen readers and keyboard navigation
