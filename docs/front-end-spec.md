* **Language accessibility:** Users can switch between English, French, and Spanish seamlessly without a page reload.

**Design Principles**

1. **Professional Credibility:** The design must convey trust and professionalism suitable for the agricultural import B2B market.  
2. **Innovative Storytelling:** Use parallax and scroll-triggered animations to progressively reveal content and create a narrative.  
3. **Performance and Polish:** All animations and effects must maintain 60fps performance on modern devices, reflecting technical excellence.  
4. **Clarity and Simplicity:** Despite the dynamic visuals, the core message and user flows must be clear and easy to follow.

### **Information Architecture (IA)**

#### **Site Map / Screen Inventory**

The homepage is a single-page application (SPA), so the site map represents sections or views rather than separate pages.

    A\[Homepage SPA\] \--\> A1\[Header\]  
    A \--\> A2\[Hero Section\]  
    A \--\> A3\[About Overview\]

    A \--\> A5\[Contact Integration\]

    A1 \--\> A1c\[Language Selector\]  
    A5 \--\> A5a\[Contact Form\]  
    A5 \--\> A5b\[Contact Info\]

#### **Navigation Structure**

Primary Navigation: Anchor-link based navigation elements within the header that smoothly scroll users to the relevant section of the single-page application. Navigation items should include "About," "Services," and "Contact".  
Secondary Navigation: The language selector for English, French, and Spanish acts as a secondary navigation element.  
Breadcrumb Strategy: Not applicable for a single-page application.

### **User Flows**

#### **User Flow: Homepage Visit & Exploration**

User Goal: A first-time visitor wants to understand what AgroVentia Inc. does, what services it offers, and how to contact the company.  
Entry Points: Direct URL entry (e.g., www.agroventia.com), search engine results, or social media links.  
Success Criteria: The user has explored the homepage, viewed the company's value proposition, services, and found the contact form.

    D \--\> M{Clicks Navigation Link};  
    M \--\> N\[Smooth Scroll to Section\];  
    N \--\> G;  
    N \--\> I;

**Edge Cases & Error Handling:**

* **Network Failure:** If content from Wix Studio CMS fails to load, a graceful fallback to a default loading state or error message should be displayed with shimmer effects.  
* **Animation Lag:** If the user's device cannot maintain 60fps, animations should degrade gracefully or be reduced for motion sensitivity.  
* **Form Validation:** Clear, real-time feedback is provided for invalid form fields, preventing submission errors.

**Notes:** This flow prioritizes a "parallax storytelling" approach where content is progressively revealed as the user scrolls, creating a guided narrative.

#### **User Flow: Language Switching**

User Goal: A visitor from a Francophone or Spanish-speaking region wants to view the website in their native language.  
Entry Points: Landing on the homepage with an English default, or directly via a language-specific URL (e.g., /fr or /esp).  
Success Criteria: The user selects a language, and the content instantly changes without a page reload.

    F \--\> G\[Content is now in French\];  
    G \--\> H\[User Continues Browsing\];

**Edge Cases & Error Handling:**

* **Next.js i18n misconfiguration:** Ensure proper fallbacks so the site doesn't break if a translation is missing.  
* **Conflicting systems:** Test for conflicts between Next.js i18n and Wix Studio CMS to ensure the correct content is displayed in the selected language.

### **Wireframes & Mockups**

**Primary Design Files:** A link to a shared design tool (e.g., Figma or Sketch) will be provided for detailed mockups.

#### **Key Screen Layouts**

Hero Section  
Purpose: Create a powerful first impression that instantly communicates AgroVentia's brand and value proposition.  
Key Elements:

* A large, high-quality agricultural-themed background image.  
* A compelling headline and sub-headline using modern typography.  
* Prominent Call-to-Action (CTA) buttons.  
* A subtle scroll indicator with an animated effect to encourage downward scrolling.  
  Interaction Notes: The background image or visual elements will move at a slower rate than the foreground text and CTA buttons, creating a parallax effect powered by GSAP.

Services Showcase  
Purpose: Clearly present the company's agricultural product categories and import services with a visual hierarchy.  
Key Elements:

* Service cards or tiles for each product category.  
* Clear icons or imagery representing each service.  
* Concise descriptions and interactive elements to reveal more information.  
  Interaction Notes: Hovering over a service card triggers a subtle GSAP transition or a state change, revealing additional details.

| Primary | \#006400 | Main brand color, used for key actions and branding elements |
| Secondary | \#A0522D | Complementary color, used for secondary actions or accents |
| Accent | \#FFD700 | Used for call-outs and micro-interactions |
| Success | \#28a745 | Positive feedback, confirmations |
| Warning | \#ffc107 | Cautions, important notices |
| Error | \#dc3545 | Errors, destructive actions |
| Neutral | \#f8f9fa, \#e9ecef, \#adb5bd, \#495057, \#212529 | Backgrounds, borders, text |

**Typography**

* **Font Families:** A modern sans-serif font will be used for both primary and secondary typography.  
* **Type Scale:** Will be defined in the design files, balancing readability with a modern appeal.

---

### **Accessibility Requirements**

**Compliance Target:** WCAG AA.

**Key Requirements**

* **Visual:**  
  * **Color contrast ratios:** Minimum 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large text.  
  * **Focus indicators:** All interactive elements will have a clear, visible focus state for keyboard navigation.  
  * **Text sizing:** Users can resize text up to 200% without loss of content or functionality.  
* **Interaction:**  
  * **Keyboard navigation:** The entire site is navigable using only a keyboard.  
  * **Screen reader support:** Proper semantic HTML structure and ARIA attributes will be used.  
  * **Touch targets:** Buttons and links will have a minimum touch target of 44x44 CSS pixels.  
* **Content:**

### **Responsiveness Strategy**

**Breakpoints**

| Breakpoint | Min Width | Max Width | Target Devices |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Mobile | 320px | 767px | Smartphones |
| Tablet | 768px | 1023px | Tablets |
| Desktop | 1024px | 2560px | Laptops, desktops, large displays |

**Adaptation Patterns:**

* **Layout Changes:** The layout will use a fluid grid system (e.g., CSS Grid or Flexbox) to reflow content seamlessly.  
* **Navigation Changes:** On mobile, the navigation will collapse into a hamburger menu.  
* **Content Priority:** Key information from the hero and services sections remains prominent on all devices.  
* **Interaction Changes:** Hover effects will be replaced by touch-friendly interactions on mobile and tablet devices.

---

### **Animation & Micro-interactions**

**Motion Principles:** Animations should be **purposeful, smooth, and performant**. They should enhance the user experience by creating a sense of premium quality and guiding the user's attention.

**Key Animations**

* **Hero Parallax:** Background elements scroll slower than foreground elements to create a sense of depth and motion.  
* **Content Reveal:** Sections will fade in or slide into view as the user scrolls, triggered by GSAP's ScrollTrigger.  
* **Button Hover:** Buttons will have a subtle background or text color change with a slight GSAP-powered lift or scale effect on hover.  
* **Shimmer Loading States:** When content is being fetched, a shimmering skeleton or placeholder will be displayed to enhance perceived performance.

---

### **Performance Considerations**

**Performance Goals**

* **Page Load:** Homepage load time must be under 2 seconds on 3G connections.  
* **Interaction Response:** All animations must maintain 60fps.  
* **Core Web Vitals:** LCP under 2.5s, FID under 100ms, and CLS under 0.1.

**Design Strategies:**

* Utilize optimized image formats (WebP, AVIF) and lazy loading.  
* Implement shimmer loading animations for enhanced perceived performance.  
* Design simple, performant animations that do not require heavy computations.
