## Risk Matrix

| Risk ID | Category | Description | Probability | Impact | Risk Score | Mitigation Status |
|---------|----------|-------------|-------------|--------|------------|-------------------|
| RSK-001 | Implementation | Current implementation uses placeholder functions instead of actual Wix SDK methods | Medium | Medium | 6 | Partially mitigated |
| RSK-002 | Security | API tokens stored in environment variables | Low | Low | 1 | Mitigated |
| RSK-003 | Performance | Cache times may need adjustment based on content update frequency | Low | Low | 1 | Acceptable |
| RSK-004 | Maintainability | Code structure follows project standards | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A |

## Risk Score Calculation
- **Critical Risks (9-10)**: 0
- **High Risks (6-8)**: 1 (RSK-001)
- **Medium Risks (3-5)**: 0
- **Low Risks (1-2)**: 2 (RSK-002, RSK-003)

## Detailed Risk Analysis

### RSK-001 - Implementation Gap
**Description**: The current implementation uses placeholder functions that return empty arrays instead of making actual calls to the Wix API.

**Probability**: Medium - The implementation will need to be updated to use real API calls for production.

**Impact**: Medium - Without real API integration, the CMS functionality won't work as intended.

**Mitigation**: 
- Recommendation added to implement actual Wix SDK methods
- This is a known limitation documented in the code comments

### RSK-002 - Security
**Description**: API tokens are stored in environment variables, which is the correct approach.

**Probability**: Low - Environment variables are a standard and secure way to store sensitive information.

**Impact**: Low - Proper security practice is being followed.

**Mitigation**: Already implemented correctly.

### RSK-003 - Performance
**Description**: Cache times are set to 5 minutes stale time and 10 minutes garbage collection time.

**Probability**: Low - These are reasonable defaults for CMS content.

**Impact**: Low - May need adjustment based on how frequently content is updated.

**Mitigation**: Values can be adjusted based on content update frequency.

## Overall Risk Profile
- **Total Risks Identified**: 3
- **High Priority Risks**: 1 (RSK-001)
- **Recommended Actions**: 
  - Implement actual Wix SDK methods
  - Monitor cache time effectiveness
  - Consider adding integration tests for actual API calls

## Risk Score
**Overall Risk Score**: 8/100 (Low risk, with one medium concern)

## Next Steps
1. Address RSK-001 by implementing actual Wix SDK methods
2. Monitor cache time effectiveness in development
3. Consider adding integration tests when actual API integration is complete
