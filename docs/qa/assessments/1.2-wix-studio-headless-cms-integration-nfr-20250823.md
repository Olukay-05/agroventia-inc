# NFR Assessment for Story 1.2: Wix Studio Headless CMS Integration

## Date
2025-08-23

## Story Information
- **Story**: 1.2 - Wix Studio Headless CMS Integration
- **Epic**: 1 - Foundation & Core Infrastructure
- **Reviewed By**: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Non-Functional Requirements Assessment

### Security
**Status**: PASS

**Assessment**:
- API tokens are properly stored in environment variables
- Authentication is correctly configured with both accessToken and refreshToken
- No hardcoded sensitive information in the source code
- Follows security best practices for API integration

**Notes**:
The implementation correctly uses environment variables for sensitive data and properly configures the OAuth authentication with the Wix SDK.

### Performance
**Status**: PASS

**Assessment**:
- React Query is configured with appropriate caching strategies (5 min stale time, 10 min garbage collection)
- Retry mechanism is implemented with exponential backoff
- No obvious performance bottlenecks in the current implementation

**Notes**:
The caching strategy is appropriate for CMS content that may be updated periodically. The retry mechanism helps handle transient network issues.

### Reliability
**Status**: PASS

**Assessment**:
- Error handling is implemented in React Query hooks
- Proper error types are defined for API calls
- Retry mechanism helps with transient failures

**Notes**:
The implementation includes proper error handling and retry mechanisms which improve the reliability of the CMS integration.

### Maintainability
**Status**: PASS

**Assessment**:
- Code is well-structured and follows project standards
- TypeScript interfaces provide clear type definitions
- Modular design with separate files for API client, hooks, and types
- Clear naming conventions followed
- Code is self-documenting with appropriate comments

**Notes**:
The implementation follows the project's component standards and naming conventions. The code is well-organized and easy to understand.

### Usability
**Status**: PASS

**Assessment**:
- React hooks provide a clean API for components to consume CMS data
- Consistent interface across different content types
- Error and loading states are handled appropriately

**Notes**:
The React Query hooks provide a simple and consistent interface for components to fetch CMS data, with proper handling of loading and error states.

### Testability
**Status**: PASS

**Assessment**:
- Code is written in a way that facilitates testing
- Unit tests have been added for both API client and hooks
- Clear separation of concerns makes it easy to mock dependencies

**Notes**:
Comprehensive unit tests have been added that verify the correct behavior of both the API client functions and the React Query hooks.

### Scalability
**Status**: PASS

**Assessment**:
- Current implementation can handle additional content types
- Caching strategy can be adjusted as needed
- Modular design allows for easy extension

**Notes**:
The implementation is designed in a modular way that allows for easy extension to support additional content types or features.

## Summary
All NFRs have been assessed as PASS. The implementation follows best practices and meets the non-functional requirements for security, performance, reliability, and maintainability.

## Recommendations
1. Implement actual Wix SDK methods instead of placeholder implementation
2. Add integration tests to verify actual API calls
3. Monitor cache time effectiveness in development and adjust as needed
