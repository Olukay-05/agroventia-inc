# AgroVentia Inc. Homepage SPA Frontend Architecture Document

## Template and Framework Selection

### Project Context Review

Based on the PRD and project brief, the AgroVentia Inc. homepage SPA will be built using **Next.js 14+** as the primary framework with the following technical requirements:
- Single Page Application (SPA) architecture
- GSAP for animations and parallax effects
- Next.js native i18n for multi-language support (English, French, Spanish)
- Wix Studio Headless CMS for basic content management
- shadcn/ui for component library
- 2-week development timeline

### Framework Decision

**Next.js 14+ with App Router** has been selected as the framework foundation. This project will use the **Next.js Create App** template as the starting point with the following justifications:
- Built-in TypeScript support and optimization
- Native internationalization (i18n) capabilities
- Excellent performance optimization features
- Seamless Vercel deployment integration
- Strong ecosystem for required integrations

### Starter Template Analysis

Using `create-next-app` with TypeScript template provides:
- Pre-configured TypeScript setup
- ESLint configuration
- App Router structure
- Built-in optimization features
- Standardized folder structure

No additional starter template is required as the project scope is focused and the base Next.js template provides sufficient foundation.
